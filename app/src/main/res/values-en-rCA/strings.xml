Retirement planning helps you determine how much money you\'ll have when you retire and whether it\'s enough to support your lifestyle.<br/><br/>

<b>How it works:</b> You start with your current savings (RRSPs, TFSAs, etc.) and add regular monthly contributions. Over time, your money grows through compound interest and investment returns. The calculator shows you:<br/>
• Total amount you\'ll have at retirement<br/>
• Monthly income you can withdraw<br/>
• How long your savings will last<br/><br/>

<b>For example</b>, if you\'re <b>30 years old</b> with <b>%1$s10,000</b> saved, contribute <b>%1$s500</b> monthly, and expect a <b>7%%</b> annual return, by age <b>65</b> you\'ll have approximately <b>%1$s1.2 million</b> for retirement.

🎯 Great planning! Here\'s your retirement outlook:<br/><br/>

<b>💰 Retirement Savings:</b><br/>
• <b>Total at Retirement:</b> %1$s (what you\'ll have saved)<br/>
• <b>Monthly Income Available:</b> %2$s (safe withdrawal amount)<br/>
• <b>Years of Income:</b> %3$s (how long it will last)<br/><br/>

<b>💡 What This Means:</b><br/>
By contributing <b>%4$s</b> monthly starting at age <b>%5$s</b>, you\'ll have <b>%1$s</b> saved by age <b>%6$s</b>. This gives you <b>%2$s</b> per month in retirement, which should last for <b>%3$s</b> years if you follow the 4%% withdrawal rule.<br/><br/>

<b>✅ Next Steps:</b><br/>
• Make sure <b>%2$s</b> monthly covers your retirement expenses<br/>
• Maximize RRSP and TFSA contributions<br/>
• Review your plan annually and adjust as needed<br/>
• Factor in CPP, OAS, and other income sources

    <!-- Net Worth Description -->
    <string name="networth_description_html"><![CDATA[
Net worth is a measure of your financial health. It\'s calculated by subtracting your total liabilities (what you owe) from your total assets (what you own).<br/><br/>
<b>Assets include:</b><br/>
- Liquid assets (cash, chequing accounts, savings accounts)<br/>
- Investment assets (stocks, bonds, mutual funds, GICs, real estate investments)<br/>
- Retirement assets (RRSPs, TFSAs, employer pension plans, LIRAs)<br/>
- Personal assets (home, vehicle, valuables, collectibles)<br/><br/>
<b>Liabilities include:</b><br/>
- Short-term debts (credit cards, lines of credit, outstanding bills)<br/>
- Long-term debts (mortgages, student loans, vehicle loans)<br/><br/>
<b>For example</b>, if you have <b>%1$s500,000</b> in assets and <b>%1$s200,000</b> in liabilities, your net worth is <b>%1$s300,000</b>.<br/><br/>
A positive net worth means you own more than you owe, which is a sign of financial stability. Tracking your net worth over time helps you measure your financial progress and make informed decisions about your money.

    <!-- Mortgage Description -->
    <string name="mortgage_description_html"><![CDATA[
A mortgage is a loan used to purchase property. The property itself serves as collateral for the loan, meaning the lender can take possession if you fail to make payments.<br/><br/>
<b>How it works:</b> When you take out a mortgage, you borrow money to buy a property and repay it over a set period (usually 25-30 years) through monthly payments. Each payment includes:<br/>
- <b>Principal:</b> The amount borrowed<br/>
- <b>Interest:</b> The cost of borrowing<br/>
- <b>Property Tax:</b> Municipal property taxes divided into monthly payments<br/>
- <b>Home Insurance:</b> Property insurance<br/>
- <b>CMHC Insurance:</b> Required when down payment is less than 20%%<br/><br/>
<b>For example</b>, if you buy a home for <b>%1$s500,000</b> with a <b>%1$s100,000</b> down payment, you\'ll borrow <b>%1$s400,000</b>. At a <b>4%%</b> interest rate over <b>25 years</b>, your monthly payment (including taxes and insurance) will be approximately <b>%1$s2,400</b>.

A tax calculator helps you estimate your combined federal and provincial income tax liability based on your income, filing status, and deductions. This helps you plan your finances and avoid surprises at tax time.<br/><br/>

<b>How it works:</b> Enter your annual income, province of residence, and deductions. The calculator estimates your tax liability using federal and provincial tax brackets and shows your effective tax rate.<br/><br/>

<b>For example</b>, if you earn <b>%1$s75,000</b> annually in Ontario with standard deductions, your combined federal and provincial tax would be approximately <b>%1$s15,000</b>.
