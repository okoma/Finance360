Superannuation planning helps you determine how much money you\'ll have when you retire and whether it\'s enough to support your lifestyle.<br/><br/>

<b>How it works:</b> You start with your current super balance and add regular contributions (including the Super Guarantee from your employer). Over time, your money grows through compound interest and investment returns. The calculator shows you:<br/>
• Total super balance at retirement<br/>
• Monthly income you can draw down<br/>
• How long your super will last<br/><br/>

<b>For example</b>, if you\'re <b>30 years old</b> with <b>%1$s10,000</b> in super, contribute <b>%1$s500</b> monthly, and expect a <b>7%%</b> annual return, by age <b>67</b> you\'ll have approximately <b>%1$s1.2 million</b> in superannuation.

🎯 Great planning! Here\'s your superannuation outlook:<br/><br/>

<b>💰 Super Savings:</b><br/>
• <b>Total Super at Retirement:</b> %1$s (what you\'ll have saved)<br/>
• <b>Monthly Income Available:</b> %2$s (safe withdrawal amount)<br/>
• <b>Years of Income:</b> %3$s (how long it will last)<br/><br/>

<b>💡 What This Means:</b><br/>
By contributing <b>%4$s</b> monthly starting at age <b>%5$s</b>, you\'ll have <b>%1$s</b> in super by age <b>%6$s</b>. This gives you <b>%2$s</b> per month in retirement, which should last for <b>%3$s</b> years if you follow the 4%% withdrawal rule.<br/><br/>

<b>✅ Next Steps:</b><br/>
• Make sure <b>%2$s</b> monthly covers your retirement expenses<br/>
• Consider salary sacrifice to boost your super<br/>
• Review your plan annually and adjust as needed<br/>
• Factor in Age Pension and other income sources

    <!-- Net Worth Description -->
    <string name="networth_description_html"><![CDATA[
Net worth is a measure of your financial health. It\'s calculated by subtracting your total liabilities (what you owe) from your total assets (what you own).<br/><br/>
<b>Assets include:</b><br/>
- Liquid assets (cash, savings accounts, transaction accounts)<br/>
- Investment assets (shares, bonds, managed funds, investment properties)<br/>
- Retirement assets (superannuation, SMSFs)<br/>
- Personal assets (home, car, valuables, collectibles)<br/><br/>
<b>Liabilities include:</b><br/>
- Short-term debts (credit cards, personal loans, outstanding bills)<br/>
- Long-term debts (home loans, investment property loans, HECS-HELP debt)<br/><br/>
<b>For example</b>, if you have <b>%1$s500,000</b> in assets and <b>%1$s200,000</b> in liabilities, your net worth is <b>%1$s300,000</b>.<br/><br/>
A positive net worth means you own more than you owe, which is a sign of financial stability. Tracking your net worth over time helps you measure your financial progress and make informed decisions about your money.

    <!-- Mortgage Description -->
    <string name="mortgage_description_html"><![CDATA[
A home loan (mortgage) is used to purchase property. The property itself serves as security for the loan, meaning the lender can repossess if you fail to make repayments.<br/><br/>
<b>How it works:</b> When you take out a home loan, you borrow money to buy a property and repay it over a set period (usually 25-30 years) through regular repayments. Each payment includes:<br/>
- <b>Principal:</b> The amount borrowed<br/>
- <b>Interest:</b> The cost of borrowing<br/>
- <b>Council Rates:</b> Annual local government charges<br/>
- <b>Strata Fees:</b> For units/apartments (if applicable)<br/>
- <b>LMI:</b> Lenders Mortgage Insurance (if deposit is less than 20%%)<br/><br/>
<b>For example</b>, if you buy a home for <b>%1$s600,000</b> with a <b>%1$s120,000</b> deposit (20%%), you\'ll borrow <b>%1$s480,000</b>. At a <b>4%%</b> interest rate over <b>30 years</b>, your monthly repayment will be approximately <b>%1$s2,300</b>.

A tax calculator helps you estimate your income tax liability based on your income, residency status, and deductions. This helps you plan your finances and understand your take-home pay.<br/><br/>

<b>How it works:</b> Enter your annual income, residency status, and deductions. The calculator estimates your tax liability using Australian tax brackets and shows your effective tax rate. Note that Medicare Levy is calculated separately.<br/><br/>

<b>For example</b>, if you earn <b>%1$s75,000</b> annually as an Australian resident with standard deductions, your taxable income results in approximately <b>%1$s14,000</b> in income tax (plus 2%% Medicare Levy).
