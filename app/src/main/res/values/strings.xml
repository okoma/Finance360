    <string name="amortization_description_html"><![CDATA[
Amortization is the process of gradually paying off a loan over time through fixed monthly payments. Each payment includes two parts:<br/><br/>
<b>Interest:</b> The cost of borrowing money<br/>
<b>Principal:</b> The amount you borrowed<br/><br/>
Over time, you pay less interest and more toward the principal with each payment. This continues until the loan is fully repaid.<br/><br/>
<b>For example</b>, let’s say you borrow <b>%1$s20,000</b> for a car at a fixed interest rate over <b>5 years</b>.<br/>
Each month, you\'ll make the same payment, but the portion that goes to interest decreases, while the portion going to the principal increases.

    <string name="amortization_explain_html">
    <![CDATA[
  Each month, you\'ll pay <b>%1$s</b> toward your loan.
  Over the entire loan term, that adds up to <b>%2$s</b> in total payments.<br/><br/>
  Out of that, <b>%3$s</b> is interest, <i>that’s the fee you pay to borrow money</i>.

    <string name="car_Laese_title">What is Car Lease?</string>
    <string name="car_lease_description_html"><![CDATA[
An auto loan is a type of loan that helps you buy a car without paying the full amount upfront.<br/><br/>

Instead, you borrow money from a lender (such as a bank, credit union, or car dealership) and repay it in fixed monthly installments — usually over <b>2</b> to <b>7</b> years.<br/>
You’ll also pay interest, which is the cost of borrowing money.<br/><br/>

Let\'s say you want to buy a car that costs <b>%1$s20,000</b>, but you only have <b>%1$s5,000</b> saved.<br/><br/>
You make a <b>%1$s5,000</b> down payment and take out a <b>%1$s15,000</b> auto loan. The loan term is <b>5 years</b> with a <b>5%%</b> annual interest rate.<br/><br/>
You\'ll make monthly payments that cover both the interest and the amount borrowed. By the end of the <b>5 years</b>, your loan will be fully paid off — and the car will be completely yours.

  🚗 Here\'s your car lease breakdown:<br/><br/>
  
  <b>💰 Lease Details:</b><br/>
  • <b>Vehicle Price:</b> %1$s<br/>
  • <b>Down Payment:</b> %2$s<br/>
  • <b>Interest Rate:</b> %3$s%% per year<br/>
  • <b>Residual Value:</b> %4$s (estimated value at end of lease)<br/>
  • <b>Lease Term:</b> %6$s months<br/><br/>
  
  <b>💵 Your Payments:</b><br/>
  • <b>Monthly Lease Payment:</b> %5$s<br/>
  • <b>Total Payments Over Lease Term:</b> %7$s (includes taxes and finance charges)<br/><br/>
  
  <b>💡 What This Means:</b><br/>
  With a lease, you\'re essentially renting the car for <b>%6$s months</b>. Your monthly payment of <b>%5$s</b> covers the vehicle\'s depreciation (how much value it loses) plus interest and fees. At the end of the lease, you can return the car or buy it for the residual value of <b>%4$s</b>.<br/><br/>
  
  <b>✅ Key Considerations:</b><br/>
  • Leasing typically has lower monthly payments than buying<br/>
  • You don\'t own the car at the end unless you buy it<br/>
  • Make sure the total cost of <b>%7$s</b> fits your budget<br/>
  • Consider mileage limits and wear-and-tear charges in your lease agreement!

  Great news! Here\'s a clear breakdown of your auto loan:<br/><br/>
  
  <b>💰 Monthly Payment:</b> %1$s<br/>
  This is the amount you\'ll pay each month. Make sure this fits comfortably in your budget!<br/><br/>
  
  <b>📊 Loan Breakdown:</b><br/>
  • <b>Amount Borrowed:</b> %3$s (the actual loan amount)<br/>
  • <b>Total Interest:</b> %4$s (the cost of borrowing this money)<br/>
  • <b>Total You\'ll Pay:</b> %2$s (loan amount + interest)<br/><br/>
  
  <b>💡 What This Means:</b><br/>
  Over the life of your loan, you\'ll pay back the <b>%3$s</b> you borrowed, plus <b>%4$s</b> in interest charges. The interest is what the lender charges for letting you borrow the money. The lower your interest rate, the less you\'ll pay overall!<br/><br/>
  
  <b>✅ Next Steps:</b><br/>
  Make sure your monthly payment of <b>%1$s</b> fits comfortably in your monthly budget. It\'s always smart to leave room for unexpected expenses and other financial goals.

    <string name="compound_interest_title">What is Compound Interest?</string>
    <string name="compound_interest_description_html"><![CDATA[
Compound interest is when you earn interest on both your initial investment and the interest that has already been earned. This creates a "snowball effect" where your money grows faster over time.<br/><br/>
<b>How it works:</b> Unlike simple interest (which only pays interest on your original amount), compound interest pays interest on your original amount plus any interest you\'ve already earned.<br/><br/>
<b>For example</b>, if you invest <b>%1$s10,000</b> at a <b>5%%</b> annual interest rate compounded monthly:<br/>
- After 1 year, you\'ll have earned interest on your <b>%1$s10,000</b><br/>
- After 2 years, you\'ll earn interest on <b>%1$s10,000</b> plus the interest from year 1<br/>
- This compounding effect accelerates your wealth growth over time<br/><br/>
The more frequently interest compounds (daily, monthly, quarterly), the faster your money grows. This is why starting early and investing regularly can significantly boost your returns.

  🎉 Excellent! Here\'s how compound interest is working for you:<br/><br/>
  
  <b>💰 Your Investment Breakdown:</b><br/>
  • <b>Initial Investment:</b> %1$s<br/>
  %4$s
  • <b>Interest Earned:</b> %5$s<br/>
  • <b>Annual Interest Rate:</b> %3$s%%<br/><br/>
  
  <b>💡 What This Means:</b><br/>
  Compound interest is like a snowball effect! Your money earns interest on your original investment, and then earns interest on that interest too. This creates exponential growth over time — the longer you invest, the faster your money grows!<br/><br/>
  
  <b>✅ Why This Matters:</b><br/>
  With compound interest, you\'re earning <b>%5$s</b> in interest, which is money working for you. The earlier you start investing and the longer you let it compound, the more wealth you can build. This is one of the most powerful tools for building long-term wealth!

    <string name="interest_only_title">What is Interest Only?</string>
    <string name="interest_only_description_html"><![CDATA[
An interest-only loan is a type of loan where you only pay the interest charges for a certain period, without paying down the principal (the amount you borrowed).<br/><br/>
<b>How it works:</b> During the interest-only period, your monthly payments are lower because you\'re only covering the interest. After this period ends, your payments increase significantly because you must pay both interest and principal.<br/><br/>
<b>For example</b>, if you borrow <b>%1$s200,000</b> at a <b>4%%</b> interest rate with a <b>5-year</b> interest-only period:<br/>
- For the first 5 years, you\'ll pay only interest (about <b>%1$s667</b> per month)<br/>
- After 5 years, you\'ll need to pay both interest and principal, which increases your monthly payment<br/><br/>
Interest-only loans are often used for mortgages or investment properties where borrowers expect their income to increase or plan to sell the property before the principal payments begin.

  • <b>Total Interest:</b> %6$s<br/>
  • <b>Amount Borrowed:</b> %1$s<br/><br/>
  
  <b>⚠️ Important to Know:</b><br/>
  During the interest-only period, your payments are lower (<b>%3$s</b>), but you\'re only paying interest — not reducing the loan amount. After this period ends, your payments jump to <b>%4$s</b> because you\'ll need to pay both interest and principal. Make sure you\'re prepared for this increase!

    <string name="loan_affordability_description_html"><![CDATA[
Loan affordability helps you determine the maximum loan amount you can borrow based on how much you can afford to pay each month.<br/><br/>
<b>How it works:</b> Instead of starting with a loan amount, you start with your maximum monthly payment. The calculator then determines the largest loan you can afford based on:<br/>
- Your maximum monthly payment<br/>
- Interest rate<br/>
- Loan term (length of repayment)<br/><br/>
<b>For example</b>, if you can afford <b>%1$s500</b> per month, with a <b>5%%</b> interest rate over <b>5 years</b>, you can afford a loan of approximately <b>%1$s26,500</b>.<br/><br/>

    <string name="mortgage_title">What is Mortgage?</string>
    <string name="mortgage_description_html"><![CDATA[
A mortgage is a loan used to purchase real estate, typically a home. The property itself serves as collateral for the loan, meaning the lender can take possession if you fail to make payments.<br/><br/>
<b>How it works:</b> When you take out a mortgage, you borrow money to buy a property and repay it over a set period (usually 15-30 years) through monthly payments. Each payment includes:<br/>
- <b>Principal:</b> The amount borrowed<br/>
- <b>Interest:</b> The cost of borrowing<br/>
- <b>Property Tax:</b> Annual taxes divided into monthly payments<br/>
- <b>Insurance:</b> Homeowners insurance<br/>
- <b>PMI:</b> Private Mortgage Insurance (if down payment is less than 20%%)<br/><br/>
<b>For example</b>, if you buy a home for <b>%1$s300,000</b> with a <b>%1$s60,000</b> down payment, you\'ll borrow <b>%1$s240,000</b>. At a <b>4%%</b> interest rate over <b>30 years</b>, your monthly payment (including taxes and insurance) will be approximately <b>%1$s1,500</b>.

    <string name="npv_title">What is Net Present Value?</string>
    <string name="npv_description_html"><![CDATA[
Net Present Value (NPV) is a financial metric used to evaluate the profitability of an investment or project by comparing the present value of cash inflows to the present value of cash outflows.<br/><br/>
<b>How it works:</b> NPV accounts for the time value of money — the concept that money today is worth more than the same amount in the future due to its earning potential. It discounts future cash flows back to their present value using a discount rate.<br/><br/>
<b>For example</b>, if you invest <b>%1$s10,000</b> today and expect to receive <b>%1$s3,000</b> per year for the next 5 years, NPV helps determine if this investment is worthwhile compared to other opportunities.<br/><br/>
<b>Interpretation:</b><br/>
- <b>Positive NPV:</b> The investment is profitable and worth pursuing<br/>
- <b>Negative NPV:</b> The investment will lose money and should be avoided<br/>
- <b>Zero NPV:</b> The investment breaks even<br/><br/>
NPV is widely used in business and finance to make investment decisions, evaluate projects, and compare different investment opportunities.

    <string name="simple_interest_title">What is Simple Interest?</string>
    <string name="simple_interest_description_html"><![CDATA[
Simple interest is a straightforward way to calculate interest on a loan or investment. Unlike compound interest, simple interest is calculated only on the original principal amount — it doesn\'t earn interest on previously earned interest.<br/><br/>
<b>How it works:</b> Simple interest is calculated using the formula:<br/>
<b>Interest = Principal × Rate × Time</b><br/><br/>
<b>For example</b>, if you invest <b>%1$s10,000</b> at a <b>5%%</b> annual interest rate for <b>3 years</b>:<br/>
- Your interest each year is <b>%1$s500</b> (5%% of %1$s10,000)<br/>
- Over 3 years, you\'ll earn <b>%1$s1,500</b> in total interest<br/>
- Your total amount will be <b>%1$s11,500</b><br/><br/>
Simple interest is commonly used for short-term loans, car loans, and some savings accounts. It\'s easier to calculate than compound interest, but typically results in lower returns over time.

Return on Investment (ROI) is a financial metric used to measure the profitability of an investment. It shows you how much profit or loss you\'ve made relative to the amount you invested.<br/><br/>
<b>How it works:</b> ROI is calculated as a percentage:<br/>
<b>ROI = (Return - Investment) / Investment × 100%%</b><br/><br/>
<b>For example</b>, if you invest <b>%1$s5,000</b> and it grows to <b>%1$s6,500</b>:<br/>

    <string name="present_value_description_html"><![CDATA[
Present Value (PV) is the current worth of a future sum of money, discounted at a specific interest rate. It helps you understand how much a future amount is worth today.<br/><br/>
<b>How it works:</b> Due to the time value of money, a dollar today is worth more than a dollar in the future because you can invest it and earn interest. Present Value discounts future amounts back to their current value.<br/><br/>
<b>For example</b>, if someone promises to pay you <b>%1$s10,000</b> in <b>5 years</b> and the discount rate is <b>5%%</b>:<br/>
- The present value is approximately <b>%1$s7,835</b><br/>
- This means <b>%1$s7,835</b> today is equivalent to <b>%1$s10,000</b> in 5 years<br/><br/>
Present Value is essential for:<br/>
- Evaluating investment opportunities<br/>
- Comparing cash flows at different times<br/>
- Making financial decisions<br/>
- Understanding the true cost of future payments<br/><br/>
It helps you make apples-to-apples comparisons between money received or paid at different times.

    <string name="rental_yield_title">What is Rental Yield?</string>
    <string name="rental_yield_description_html"><![CDATA[
Rental yield is a percentage that measures the annual rental income from a property relative to its purchase price. It helps investors evaluate the profitability of rental properties.<br/><br/>
<b>How it works:</b> There are two types of rental yield:<br/>
- <b>Gross Yield:</b> Annual rental income ÷ Property price × 100%%<br/>
- <b>Net Yield:</b> (Annual rental income - Expenses) ÷ Property price × 100%%<br/><br/>
<b>For example</b>, if you buy a property for <b>%1$s200,000</b> and rent it for <b>%1$s1,500</b> per month:<br/>
- Annual rental income: <b>%1$s18,000</b><br/>
- Gross yield: <b>9%%</b> (%1$s18,000 ÷ %1$s200,000 × 100%%)<br/>
- After expenses of <b>%1$s3,000</b>, net yield: <b>7.5%%</b><br/><br/>
Rental yield helps you:<br/>
- Compare different investment properties<br/>
- Assess if a property is a good investment<br/>
- Understand your return before property appreciation<br/>
- Make informed real estate decisions<br/><br/>
A higher yield generally indicates a better rental investment, but you should also consider property appreciation, location, and market conditions.

- <b>Loan 2:</b> 3.5%% interest, 15 years → Higher monthly payment, lower total interest<br/><br/>
Loan comparison helps you:<br/>
- Choose the loan that fits your budget<br/>
- Minimize total interest costs<br/>
- Understand the true cost of each option<br/>
- Make informed borrowing decisions<br/><br/>
Consider both your monthly budget and long-term financial goals when comparing loans. Sometimes a slightly higher monthly payment can save you thousands in interest over time.

  📊 Side-by-side comparison of your two loan options:<br/><br/>
  
  <b>💳 Loan 1:</b><br/>
  • Monthly Payment: %1$s<br/>
  • Total Payments: %2$s<br/>
  • Total Interest: %3$s<br/>
  • Processing Fee: %4$s<br/><br/>
  
  <b>💳 Loan 2:</b><br/>
  • Monthly Payment: %5$s<br/>
  • Total Payments: %6$s<br/>
  • Total Interest: %7$s<br/>
  • Processing Fee: %8$s<br/><br/>
  
  <b>💡 What This Means:</b><br/>
  %9$s This comparison helps you see which loan offers better value. Consider both your monthly budget (can you afford the monthly payment?) and your long-term goals (do you want to minimize total interest?).<br/><br/>
  
  <b>✅ Decision Tips:</b><br/>
  • If monthly cash flow is tight, choose the loan with the lower monthly payment<br/>
  • If you want to save money long-term, choose the loan with lower total interest<br/>
  • Don\'t forget to factor in processing fees when comparing total costs!

    <string name="refinance_title">What is Refinancing?</string>
    <string name="refinance_description_html"><![CDATA[
Refinancing is the process of replacing an existing loan with a new loan that has different terms, typically to get a lower interest rate, reduce monthly payments, or change the loan duration.<br/><br/>
<b>How it works:</b> When you refinance, you take out a new loan to pay off your current loan. The new loan may have:<br/>
- A lower interest rate (saving you money over time)<br/>
- Different loan terms (shorter or longer duration)<br/>
- Different monthly payment amounts<br/><br/>
<b>For example</b>, if you have a <b>%1$s200,000</b> mortgage at <b>5%%</b> interest:<br/>
- Current monthly payment: <b>%1$s1,074</b><br/>
- Refinancing to <b>3.5%%</b> could reduce payment to <b>%1$s898</b><br/>
- You could save <b>%1$s176</b> per month or <b>%1$s63,360</b> over 30 years<br/><br/>
<b>Considerations:</b><br/>
- Refinancing fees and closing costs<br/>
- How long you plan to stay in the home<br/>
- Whether you\'ll break even on the costs<br/>
- Your credit score and financial situation<br/><br/>
Refinancing can be a smart financial move, but it\'s important to calculate whether the savings outweigh the costs.
    ]]></string>
    <string name="refinance_explain_html">
    <![CDATA[
  🔄 Here\'s how refinancing compares to your current loan:<br/><br/>
  
  <b>📋 Current Loan:</b><br/>
  • Monthly Payment: %1$s<br/>
  • Total Payments: %2$s<br/>
  • Total Interest: %3$s<br/><br/>
  
  <b>🆕 Refinanced Loan:</b><br/>
  • Monthly Payment: %4$s<br/>
  • Total Payments: %5$s<br/>
  • Total Interest: %6$s<br/>
  • Refinancing Fees: %7$s (upfront cost)<br/><br/>
  
  <b>💡 What This Means:</b><br/>
  %8$s Refinancing can help you save money, but you need to make sure the savings justify the upfront costs. The refinancing fees of <b>%7$s</b> need to be covered by your savings over time.<br/><br/>
  
  <b>✅ Key Considerations:</b><br/>
  • How long do you plan to keep the loan? (Longer = more time to recoup fees)<br/>
  • Monthly savings: Compare <b>%1$s</b> vs <b>%4$s</b><br/>
  • Total savings: Compare <b>%2$s</b> vs <b>%5$s</b><br/>
  • Make sure the savings outweigh the <b>%7$s</b> in fees!

    <string name="bond_yield_title">What is Bond Yield?</string>
    <string name="bond_yield_description_html"><![CDATA[
Bond yield is the return an investor receives on a bond investment. It\'s expressed as a percentage and represents the income you\'ll earn relative to the bond\'s price.<br/><br/>
<b>Types of Bond Yield:</b><br/>
- <b>Current Yield:</b> Annual coupon payment ÷ Current market price × 100%%<br/>
- <b>Yield to Maturity (YTM):</b> The total return if you hold the bond until it matures<br/><br/>
<b>For example</b>, if you buy a bond with:<br/>
- Face value (par): <b>%1$s1,000</b><br/>
- Current price: <b>%1$s950</b><br/>
- Annual coupon rate: <b>5%%</b> (<b>%1$s50</b> per year)<br/>
- Current yield: <b>5.26%%</b> (%1$s50 ÷ %1$s950 × 100%%)<br/><br/>
<b>Key factors:</b><br/>
- <b>Coupon Rate:</b> The interest rate the bond pays<br/>
- <b>Current Price:</b> What you pay to buy the bond<br/>
- <b>Par Value:</b> The face value repaid at maturity<br/>
- <b>Years to Maturity:</b> How long until the bond matures<br/><br/>
Understanding bond yields helps you compare different bond investments and make informed decisions about fixed-income securities.

  📈 Here\'s your bond investment analysis:<br/><br/>
  
  <b>💵 Bond Details:</b><br/>
  • Current Price: %1$s (what you pay to buy it)<br/>
  • Par Value: %2$s (what you\'ll get back at maturity)<br/>
  %3$s
  • Years to Maturity: %4$s<br/><br/>
  
  <b>📊 Your Yields:</b><br/>
  • <b>Current Yield:</b> %5$s%% (annual return based on current price)<br/>
  • <b>Yield to Maturity:</b> %6$s%% (total return if held until maturity)<br/><br/>
  
  <b>💡 What This Means:</b><br/>
  %7$s The current yield of <b>%5$s%%</b> shows your annual return based on what you pay today. The yield to maturity of <b>%6$s%%</b> reflects your total return if you hold the bond until it matures. Higher yields mean better returns!<br/><br/>
  
  <b>✅ Important Considerations:</b><br/>
  While higher yields are generally better, also consider the bond\'s credit risk (how likely it is to default) and whether it aligns with your investment goals and timeline. Make sure this bond fits your overall investment strategy!

Retirement planning helps you determine how much money you\'ll have when you retire and whether it\'s enough to support your lifestyle.<br/><br/>

<b>How it works:</b> You start with your current savings and add regular monthly contributions. Over time, your money grows through compound interest and investment returns. The calculator shows you:<br/>
• Total amount you\'ll have at retirement<br/>
• Monthly income you can withdraw<br/>
• How long your savings will last<br/><br/>

<b>For example</b>, if you\'re <b>30 years old</b> with <b>%1$s10,000</b> saved, contribute <b>%1$s500</b> monthly, and expect a <b>7%%</b> annual return, by age <b>65</b> you\'ll have approximately <b>%1$s1.2 million</b> for retirement.

    <string name="retirement_explain_html"><![CDATA[
🎯 Great planning! Here\'s your retirement outlook:<br/><br/>

<b>💰 Retirement Savings:</b><br/>
• <b>Total at Retirement:</b> %1$s (what you\'ll have saved)<br/>
• <b>Monthly Income Available:</b> %2$s (safe withdrawal amount)<br/>
• <b>Years of Income:</b> %3$s (how long it will last)<br/><br/>

<b>💡 What This Means:</b><br/>
By contributing <b>%4$s</b> monthly starting at age <b>%5$s</b>, you\'ll have <b>%1$s</b> saved by age <b>%6$s</b>. This gives you <b>%2$s</b> per month in retirement, which should last for <b>%3$s</b> years if you follow the 4%% withdrawal rule.<br/><br/>

<b>✅ Next Steps:</b><br/>
• Make sure <b>%2$s</b> monthly covers your retirement expenses<br/>
• Consider increasing contributions if you want more income<br/>
• Review your plan annually and adjust as needed<br/>
• Factor in Social Security and other income sources

An emergency fund is money set aside to cover unexpected expenses like medical bills, job loss, or major repairs. Financial experts recommend having 3-6 months of expenses saved.<br/><br/>

<b>How it works:</b> The calculator determines how much you need based on your monthly expenses and desired months of coverage. It also shows how long it will take to reach your goal based on your monthly savings.<br/><br/>

<b>For example</b>, if your monthly expenses are <b>%1$s3,000</b> and you want <b>6 months</b> of coverage, you need <b>%1$s18,000</b> in your emergency fund. If you save <b>%1$s500</b> monthly, it will take about <b>3 years</b> to reach your goal.

• <b>Current Savings:</b> %3$s<br/>
• <b>Amount Needed:</b> %4$s<br/>
• <b>Monthly Savings:</b> %5$s<br/>
• <b>Time to Goal:</b> %6$s months (%7$s years)<br/><br/>

<b>💡 What This Means:</b><br/>
With monthly expenses of <b>%8$s</b>, you need <b>%1$s</b> to cover <b>%2$s</b> months. You currently have <b>%3$s</b>, so you need to save <b>%4$s</b> more. At <b>%5$s</b> per month, you\'ll reach your goal in <b>%6$s</b> months.<br/><br/>

<b>✅ Next Steps:</b><br/>
• Keep your emergency fund in a high-yield savings account<br/>
• Only use it for true emergencies<br/>
• Replenish it if you need to withdraw funds<br/>
• Consider increasing to 6-12 months if you\'re self-employed

<b>For example</b>, if you have <b>%1$s5,000</b> in credit card debt at <b>18%%</b> APR and pay only the minimum (<b>%1$s100</b>), it could take <b>8+ years</b> to pay off with thousands in interest. Paying <b>%1$s200</b> monthly cuts that to <b>2.5 years</b>.

💳 Your credit card payoff plan:<br/><br/>

<b>📊 Payoff Details:</b><br/>
• <b>Credit Card Balance:</b> %1$s<br/>
• <b>APR:</b> %2$s%%<br/>
• <b>Monthly Payment:</b> %3$s<br/>
• <b>Payoff Time:</b> %4$s months (%5$s years)<br/>
• <b>Total Interest:</b> %6$s<br/>
• <b>Total Paid:</b> %7$s<br/><br/>

<b>💡 What This Means:</b><br/>
Paying <b>%3$s</b> monthly on your <b>%1$s</b> balance at <b>%2$s%%</b> APR will take <b>%4$s</b> months. You\'ll pay <b>%6$s</b> in interest, bringing your total to <b>%7$s</b>.<br/><br/>

<b>✅ Tips to Pay Off Faster:</b><br/>
• Pay more than the minimum whenever possible<br/>
• Consider a balance transfer to a 0%% APR card<br/>
• Use the debt avalanche method (highest APR first)<br/>
• Stop using the card while paying it off<br/>
• Even <b>%8$s</b> extra monthly saves <b>%9$s</b> in interest!

A tax calculator helps you estimate your income tax liability based on your income, filing status, and deductions. This helps you plan your finances and avoid surprises at tax time.<br/><br/>

<b>How it works:</b> Enter your annual income, filing status (Single, Married, etc.), and deductions. The calculator estimates your tax liability using standard tax brackets and shows your effective tax rate.<br/><br/>

<b>For example</b>, if you earn <b>%1$s75,000</b> annually as a single filer with <b>%1$s12,000</b> in deductions, your taxable income is <b>%1$s63,000</b>, resulting in approximately <b>%1$s9,500</b> in federal taxes.

📋 Your tax estimate:<br/><br/>

<b>💰 Tax Details:</b><br/>
• <b>Annual Income:</b> %1$s<br/>
• <b>Filing Status:</b> %2$s<br/>
• <b>Deductions:</b> %3$s<br/>
• <b>Taxable Income:</b> %4$s<br/>
• <b>Estimated Tax:</b> %5$s<br/>
• <b>Tax Withheld:</b> %6$s<br/>
• <b>Refund/Owed:</b> %7$s<br/>
• <b>Effective Tax Rate:</b> %8$s%%<br/><br/>

<b>💡 What This Means:</b><br/>
With <b>%1$s</b> income and <b>%3$s</b> deductions, your taxable income is <b>%4$s</b>. Your estimated tax is <b>%5$s</b>, giving you an effective tax rate of <b>%8$s%%</b>. You\'ve already had <b>%6$s</b> withheld, so you\'ll %9$s <b>%7$s</b>.<br/><br/>

<b>✅ Tax Tips:</b><br/>
• Maximize deductions and credits when possible<br/>
• Consider contributing to retirement accounts to reduce taxable income<br/>
• Adjust withholding if you consistently owe or get large refunds<br/>
• Consult a tax professional for complex situations<br/>
• Keep records of all deductions and expenses
